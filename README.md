# JS REPL Game

For your game, you want to output some introduction using console.log() and get a response with readlineSync.question(). Then use the user responses data to advance in your game.
You want to control what happens in the game even when the user submits an invalid answer.
Project requirements:

    Be creative
    Your game should have at least 3 steps
    Some questions must depend on previous responses to questions. (“Choose your own Adventure” style.)

Your code should run smoothly (no errors).
Make sure you push yourself outside of your comfort zone to explore new methods and techniques.
